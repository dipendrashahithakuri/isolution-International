                <p>I Solution International Pvt. Ltd. recognizes that Personal Insurance needs to be "personalized" and customized to your unique situation. We take the time to compare multiple companies and combinations of selected coverages to protect not only your assets but the people who use them. </p>
                <p>Insurance can be confusing, but it doesn't need to be that way. We take the time to educate our customers, to truly evaluate their needs. As an independent agency, we provide a custom blend of options and prices from multiple insurance companies. This requires us to take more time up front truly shopping around for your best fit. Anyone can put a quote form on the internet and tell you this is the best price, but that's not service - that's not making sure you have the appropriate coverages - that's a machine.  Our personal approach means we take the time to understand your priorities, your health concerns and your budget.</p>
                <p>You should consider your life insurance coverage as part of your financial planning process. Life insurance protects you from life's uncertainties, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Correctly planned life insurance can protect your family from the uncertainties of living expenses, monies due and mortgages. </li>
                    <li>Life insurance provides tax free cash to pay estate and to help support your business and personal expenses. </li>
                    <li>Some policies have savings or pension components to help with retirement expenses</li>
                    <li>If your income supports your family's life style, life insurance helps them maintain that standard of living should you suddenly die.</li>
                    <li>As a business partner, life insurance protects the business from financial loss and liability should a partner die.</li> 
                    <li>Life insurance policies are exempt from creditors in bankruptcy cases.</li>
                    <li>Life insurance can pay for your funeral expenses and some coverages have options for critical illness or term insurance. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>A leading healthcare site lists these top 8 reasons for carrying health insurance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Helps protect you from the financial hardships that may result from health care expense.</li>
                    <li>When you need medical care, you may not be able to afford it</li>
                    <li>Insured individuals tend to visit the hospital before a condition becomes worse and more expensive to treat.</li>
                    <li>Diabetics without health insurance have a higher mortality rate than those that carry insurance.</li>
                    <li>Hospitals have the legal right to place a lien against your property if you do not pay their bills</li>
                    <li>Some higher education facility will not allow you to enroll without proof of health insurance.</li>
                </ul>
